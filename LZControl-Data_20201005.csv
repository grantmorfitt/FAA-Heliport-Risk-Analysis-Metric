Update rcvd November 2011 - ALTERNATE LZ SHOULD PRIMARY PAD BECOME NON-OPERATIONAL:

&quot;The alternate landing site will be the grassy area to the right of the Emergency Entrance&#044; off Medical Campus Road&#044; unless snowy or muddy.  If these conditions occur&#044; the front left-hand side corner&#044; located to the left of the Emergency Entrance (where it is currently blocked off for valet parking) will be used.


The alternate LZ is the grass firld 100 yards NW of the primary pad on the NW side of the parking lot entrance road.

Contact Charlotte Approach on 120.05 when 20 to 25 miles out from our main hospital.
Notify Approach that you are inbound to Carolinas Medical Center and obtain clearance into Class B Airspace prior to penetrating the 7 NM arc around the Charlotte VOR (115.0).
Contact MedCenter Air Dispatch (Flight Watch) on primary 155.325 - PL 10 (91.5) or secondary 123.025.
Recommend 1500&#039; - 1800&#039; MSL for altitude.
Fly to a point just south of the skyscrapers of Charlotte (approximately 1/4 mile). Fly over top of the large hotel next to the Interstate 277.
Contact MedCenter Air Flight Watch and report &quot;North IP for Pad?&quot;
Follow the four-lane road (Kings Drive) southwest leading from the interstate area towards Carolinas Medical Center. When near the hospital at 500&#039; AGL&#044; make the turn toward Pad 1&#044; 2 or 3.
Avoid flying any other route into or out of the hospital for noise abatement. Avoid low flight over residential areas near the hospital.
If the patient&#039;s condition is extremely critical&#044; you can fly directly to the helipads. However&#044; notify MedCenter Air Flight Watch or one of our crew members so a flight deviation report can be completed.
For departure from CMC helipad&#044; contact MCA (Flight Watch) on primary 155.325 - PL 10 (91.5) or secondary 123.025 prior to start&#044; then Charlotte ATC Tower while on the helipad on frequency 118.1.

Flight planning - direct to Watertown (KART) then to Chaumont. This will keep the aircraft feet dry the entire flight. Direct to the Pulaski Highway Dept LZ&#044; KART then Chaumont. Again keeps the aircraft feet dry the entire flight. If wx allows you can hug the coast line on the southern portion o the lake then straight to KART. 
Be aware you may find snow-mobile traffic&#044; trailers in&#044; on or around the LZ in winter months. Apparently one of the local snowmobile clubs put out that the lot was a rally/node point for one of their rallies. If we are called you may see FD personnel herding/blocking this traffic. I would imagine it will be pretty clear by the time we arrive. The Chief has spoken to the club but he anticipates it to take a while for the word to get out to everyone."
